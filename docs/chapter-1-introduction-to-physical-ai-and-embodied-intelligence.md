# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core principles of Physical AI
- Explore the relationship between embodiment and intelligence
- Learn about the applications of humanoid robotics

## Content

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional AI approaches that focus primarily on perception and cognition to systems that integrate these capabilities with physical interaction in the real world. This integration between perception, reasoning, and action in physical environments creates new opportunities and challenges for robotic systems.

Embodied intelligence refers to the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Rather than processing information in isolation, embodied systems leverage their physical form and environmental interactions to simplify complex cognitive tasks.

## Key Concepts

- **Embodiment**: The physical form of the agent influences its cognitive processes
- **Morphological Computation**: The physical structure contributes to information processing
- **Affordances**: Environmental features that suggest possible actions

## Summary

This chapter has introduced the foundational concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence that will be explored in greater detail throughout the textbook.
