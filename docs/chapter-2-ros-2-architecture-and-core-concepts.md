# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts

This chapter covers the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) architecture and core concepts essential for humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand ROS 2 architecture and middleware
- Learn about nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Explore ROS 2 launch systems and parameters

## Content

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides the middleware and tools necessary for developing complex robotic applications. It addresses the limitations of ROS 1 by providing improved security, real-time capabilities, and better support for commercial applications.

The core concepts include:

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous communication with feedback and goal preemption

## Key Concepts

- **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: The underlying middleware for ROS 2
- **Packages**: Organizational units containing code and resources
- **Launch files**: XML/YAML files to start multiple nodes at once

## Summary

This chapter has introduced the ROS 2 architecture that forms the foundation for all subsequent robotics development in this textbook.
